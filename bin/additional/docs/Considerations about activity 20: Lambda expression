Posssible variant of  20 activity:Lambda expression


In the exercise we have to change a code  with use lambda expression.

For example, we have this code, without lambda expression:

List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
for (String string : strings) {
	System.out.println("Content: " + string);
}

To pass unit test we need to remake it with lambda expression, like this:

List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
strings.stream().forEach((string) -> {
	System.out.println("Content: " + string);
});


Can reuse existing code in Activity 20.
