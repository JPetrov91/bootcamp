= Set up tested class =
1. Implement Student manager class, similarly to TeacherManager class in activity13.
2. You can simply copy-paste methods and make necessary changes for TeacherManager.
3. Note that you can introduce bugs here, as it can be that not all necessary changes are done correctly.

= Creation of new JUnit test case =

1. Right-click on org.activity18 package in Package Explorer and select: New— New JUnit Test Case.
2. In New JUnit Test case window:
  a. Check that test version is: New JUnit 4 test,
  b. Check that test location is: .../src/main/java,
  c. Check that package is: org.activity18,
  d. Set test Name: DatabaseUnitTest1 (this name important, as it will be used for automated execution)
  e. Mark setUpBeforeClass(), tearDownAfterClass() if necessary,
  f. Mark setUp() and tearDown() if necessary,
  g. Mark GenerateComments if necessary,
  h. Set Class under test: org.activity18.StudentManager,
  i. Press Next.
3. In Test methods window:
  a. Mark StudentManager class, to test all its methods,
  b. Mark Create final method stubs, if necessary,
  c. Mark Create tasks for generated tests methods, if necessary,
  d. Press Finish.

= Implement Testing of package18 =
1. Implement previously generated test methods to check that Student and StudentManager classes work properly.

= Manual testing =

1. Select: Run— Run as— JUnit test, to test this file as simple unit test.
2. Right-click on test (or package) in Package explorer and select: Coverage as– JUnit test, to check coverage of the tested classes.

= Automated testing =

Automated testing and coverage reporting is performed by DatabaseUnitTest.java test, which is compiled in JTM.jar package.
To test, how it will work manually you can do following.

1. Create your own calling class, e.g. DatabaseCoverageTest.java with following body:
   package org.activity18;
     public class DatabaseCoverageTest {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
     	 DatabaseUnitTest dbUnitTest = new DatabaseUnitTest();
     	 dbUnitTest.test();
     }
   }

2. Select: Run— Run as...— Java application, to check, how your test will be executed from the automated test suite

Note: don't create JUnit test to check automated coverage testing as it can produce wrong results for coverage reporting!

2. Modify Test suite:
  a. open AllTests.java class in org.testSuite package,
  b. if necessary, comment out unneeded classes from ..allTests() {printStat(  list,..
  c. run Test suite.
